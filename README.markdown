# Heptavis: The Heptagram Visualizer

[Live Demo](https://kappter.github.io/heptavis/)

An interactive, animated SVG tool for exploring the geometric, musical, and symbolic beauty of the heptagram—a seven-pointed star—through rotating overlays, planetary glyphs, chakra mappings, musical notes, and angle markers.

- 🔺 **Chakra Wheel**: Earthy-colored wedges with detailed attributes.
- 📅 **Days of the Week**: Mapped to chakras (e.g., Music Monday, Tech Tuesday).
- 📐 **Angle Markers**: 51.43° segments with degree labels.
- 🍽️ **Food Suggestions**: Chakra-specific dietary recommendations.
- 🧘 **Focus Areas**: Spiritual and practical focus for each chakra.

## 🧠 Background & Purpose
Heptavis explores the mystical power of seven:
- The heptagram as a path to pattern recognition.
- Ancient seven-day week cycles and their symbolic significance.
- Chakra alignment, planetary correspondences, musical structure, and lifestyle integration.
- A tool for artists, mystics, educators, and theorists.

## 📌 To-Do / Ideas
- Add sound feedback for musical notes (e.g., play frequencies on hover).
- Enable angle snapping or fine-tuned rotation control.
- Integrate a time-of-day indicator synced with planetary times.
- Add exercise overlays or a guided meditation mode.
- Support PNG or animated GIF export.
