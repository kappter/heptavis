# Heptavis: The Heptagram Visualizer

Heptavis is an interactive web-based tool designed to explore the mystical and holistic connections within a seven-pointed star, aligning with the seven chakras, days of the week, and associated metaphysical properties. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers a visually engaging interface to reflect on personal growth, energy alignment, and rhythmic harmony. Users can customize the visualization by rotating layers, selecting different data perspectives (chakras, days, notes, etc.), and mapping any combination of attributes to each day. Whether for meditation, self-discovery, or creative inspiration, Heptavis provides a dynamic canvas to explore the interplay of body, mind, and spirit.

## Features
- **Interactive Heptagram**: Visualize a seven-pointed star with rotatable layers representing chakras, days, angles, planets, notes, foods, elements, and crystals.
- **Layer Selection**: Switch between different data layers (e.g., chakras, food) to focus on specific attributes using radio buttons.
- **Day Navigation**: Cycle through Sunday to Saturday using a dropdown menu, previous/next buttons, or arrow keys, with the current day (Friday, August 01, 2025) highlighted.
- **Custom Mapping**: Use the "Cycle Mapping" button to reorder all data fields (chakra, day, note, etc.) for each day, enabling full personalization.
- **Rotation Control**: Adjust the star’s rotation with a slider, snapping to 51.43° increments for precise alignment.
- **Audio Feedback**: Play the 4th octave frequency (e.g., 293.66 Hz for Sacral) associated with the selected day’s chakra.
- **SVG Export**: Download the current visualization as an SVG file for sharing or further use.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across platforms.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Includes detailed attributes like focus, frequency, planet glyphs, food, element, and crystal for each chakra/day.

## Purposes
- **Self-Reflection**: Encourage users to meditate on the energy centers (chakras) and their corresponding days.
- **Educational Tool**: Provide insights into metaphysical associations (e.g., elements, crystals) linked to each day.
- **Creative Exploration**: Allow users to experiment with custom mappings for artistic or spiritual inspiration.
- **Holistic Alignment**: Facilitate a deeper connection between daily routines (e.g., food choices) and energetic balance.
- **Community Sharing**: Enable users to save and share their personalized heptagram visualizations.
