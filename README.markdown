# Heptavis: The Heptagram Visualizer

[Live Demo](https://kappter.github.io/heptavis/)

An interactive, animated SVG tool for exploring the geometric, musical, and symbolic beauty of the heptagram—a seven-pointed star—through rotating overlays, planetary glyphs, chakra mappings, musical notes, and angle markers.

## ✨ Features
- 🔁 **Animated Rotation**: Toggleable auto-rotation for all layers or independent control.
- 🎵 **Musical Notes**: Aligned to chakras (C, D, E, F♯, G♯, A♯, B) with frequencies.
- 🪐 **Planetary Glyphs**: Classical astrology symbols (Sun, Moon, Mars, etc.).
- 🔺 **Chakra Wheel**: Earthy-colored wedges with detailed attributes.
- 📅 **Day of Week**: Mapped to chakras (e.g., Music Monday, Tech Tuesday).
- 📐 **Angle Markers**: 51.43° segments with degree labels.
- 🍽️ **Foods**: Chakra-specific dietary recommendations.
- 🧘 **Focus**: Spiritual and practical focus for each chakra.
- 💪 **Exercise**: Chakra-aligned physical exercises.
- 🦴 **Body Focus**: Areas of the body tied to each chakra.
- 🎨 **Color**: Chakra-specific color representations.
- 🔊 **Frequency Playback**: Play the frequency for the current day with a button.
- 🖌️ **Masking**: Highlight the current day’s chakra with an optional mask.
- 📝 **Custom Text Display**: Select which data (Day, Food, etc.) to show line-by-line in the active section.
- 🔄 **Independent Rotation**: Adjust each layer's rotation with improved text orientation.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive UI for phones and tablets.
- ⬇️ **SVG Download**: Export your visualization as an SVG file.

## 🧠 Background & Purpose
Heptavis explores the mystical power of seven:
- The heptagram as a path to pattern recognition.
- Ancient seven-day week cycles and their symbolic significance.
- Chakra alignment, planetary correspondences, musical structure, and lifestyle integration.
- A tool for artists, mystics, educators, and theorists.

## 📌 To-Do / Ideas
- Add frequency duration control for playback.
- Enable angle snapping for precise rotation increments.
- Add a time-of-day overlay synced with planetary times.
- Support PNG or animated GIF export.
